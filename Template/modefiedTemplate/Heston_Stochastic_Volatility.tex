\section{Introduction}

The Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library (GAIL) is a suite of algorithms that includes Monte Carlo methods for multidimensional integration and computation of means, which is developed by Professor Hickernell and his collaborators. GAIL has theoretical guarantees that the user-defined error tolerance will be met. The financial application module of GAIL is under construction, and our work is aimed to add algorithms of calculating stochastic volatility model in the asset path class. There are several well-known stochastic volatility models: the Hull-white model (1987), the Scott-Chesny model (1989), the Heston model (1993) and the SABR model (2002). The Heston model is of particular interest to us since it is one of the most widely used stochastic volatility models.


We apply the Quadratic Exponential (QE) algorithm to simulate the volatility process and use the Broadie-Kaya scheme (2006) to discretize the asset price process. The QE model was developed by Andersen (2006). It is a market standard simulation method for the Heston model. Its attractiveness lies in its efficiency. It relies on simple probability density functions and needs a moderate amount of storage. Depending on the value of the volatility, the QE scheme approximates its distribution using either Gaussian or exponential distribution. After getting the value of the volatility for each time step, we discretize the asset price process. As we know, the computation of Broadie-Kaya algorithm is time consuming, but it is bias-free by construction. We discretize its scheme to get the simulation of the dynamic of asset price process. The Broadie-Kaya scheme does not satisfy an equivalent discrete-time martingale condition. The martingale property can be attained by adjusting a certain term in the scheme.


The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the implementation of the QE scheme in GAIL so that we get the simulation algorithm of Heston model with guaranteed automatically realized user-defined error tolerance. When setting the volatility of the volatility of the asset price process as zero, the algorithm works like the algorithm of asset price process with deterministic volatility. For deterministic volatility case, we compare the results with other simulation methods such as geometric Brownian motion and quasi-Monte Carlo. It shows that the new algorithm is accurate and fast. Second, we apply variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling, control variates and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods to increase accuracy. The advantages of the new algorithm is strengthened.


The setup of the paper is as follows: we first introduce Heston model, QE scheme and the brief idea behind GAIL. Then, we explain our new algorithm and the improved algorithm using variance reduction techniques. At last, we show its performance in comparison with various widespread used schemes and with different variance reduction applications

\section{Options Modeled by the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model}
\subsection{Heston Model}
Heston model is defined as
 \begin{align}
    \d X & =\mu X\,\d t+\sqrt{V}X\,\d W_1\label{eq1}\\
    \d V &= -\kappa (\theta-V)\,\d t +\nu\sqrt{V}\,\d W_2\label{eq2}
  \end{align}
\begin{align*}
\text{where }&\\
   & \d W_1 \text{ and } \d W_2 \text{ are two standard Brownian motions which are correlated}\\
   &\rho \text{ is the correlation,} \\
   & \mu \text{ is the the risk-free interest rate,}\\%r \text{ and } d \text{ are respectively the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate and dividend yield,}  \\
   & \kappa \text{ is the speed of mean reversion,} \\
   & \theta \text{ is the value of the long-term variance,} \\
   & \nu \text{ is the volatility of volatility.}
\end{align*}

Applying the Ito's formula to \eqref{eq1}, an equivalent form to simulate the process of asset price is shown in Eq.(\ref{logX}).
\begin{equation}\label{logX}
  \d\ln(X)=(\mu-\frac{V}{2})\,\d t+\sqrt{V}\,\d W_1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Quadratic Exponential Scheme}
We applied the Quadratic Exponential Scheme illustrated in Andersen (2006) \cite{Andersen} to simulate the volatility process. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $\hat{V}(t)$, compute $m$ and $s^2$ from following equations
\begin{align*}
  m &=\theta + (\hat{V}(t)-\theta)e^{-\kappa\Delta} \\
  s^2 &=\frac{\hat{V}(t)\nu^2 e^{-\kappa\Delta}}{\kappa}\bigg(1-e^{-\kappa\Delta}\bigg)+\frac{\theta\nu^2}{2\kappa}\bigg(1-e^{-\kappa\Delta}\bigg)^2
\end{align*}
\item Compute $\psi=s^2/m^2$\\
\item Draw a uniform random number $U_V$
\item If $\psi\leq\psi_c$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $a$ and $b$ from following equations
\begin{align*}
  b^2 & =2\psi^{-1}-1+\sqrt{2\psi^{-1}}\sqrt{2\psi^{-1}-1}\geq 0 \\
  a & =\frac{m}{1+b^2}
\end{align*}
\item Compute $Z_V=\Phi^{-1}(U_V)$
\item Set $\hat{V}(t+\Delta)=a(b+Z_V)^2$
\end{enumerate}
\item Otherwise, if $\psi>\psi_c$
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute $\beta$ and $p$ according to equations
  \begin{align*}
    p & =\frac{\psi-1}{\psi+1}\in[0,1) \\
    \beta & =\frac{1-p}{m}=\frac{2}{m(\psi+1)}>0
  \end{align*}
  \item set $\hat{V}(t+\Delta)=\Psi^{-1}(U_V;p,\beta)$
  \begin{equation*}
    \Psi(x) = \text{Pr}(\hat{V}(t+\Delta)\leq x) = p+(1-p)(1-e^{-\beta x}),\, x\geq 0
  \end{equation*}
  \[
  \Psi^{-1}(u)=\Psi^{-1}(u;p,\beta)=
  \begin{cases}
    0,\,&0\leq u \leq p,\\
    \beta^{-1}\ln(\frac{1-p}{1-u}),&p<u\leq1
  \end{cases}
  \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Broadie-Kaya discretization scheme for $\hat{X}$}
First we integrate the SDE for $V(t)$ to have a bias-free scheme,
\begin{equation*}
  V(t+\Delta) = V(t)+\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\kappa(\theta-V(u))\,\d u +\nu\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W_V(u)
\end{equation*}
and it can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{dW_V}
\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W_V(u)=\nu^{-1}\bigg(V(t+\Delta)- V(t)-\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\kappa(\theta-V(u))\,\d u\bigg)
\end{equation}
Recall \eqref{logX}, by Cholesky decomposition, we have
\begin{equation*}
 \d \ln X(t)=(\mu-\frac{1}{2}V(t))\,\d t +\sqrt{V(t)}\big(\rho\,\d W_V(t)+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\,\d W(t)\big)
\end{equation*}
where $W$ is a Brownian motion independent of $W_V$.

Now we integrate the above equation,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \ln X(t+\Delta)=&\ln X(t) +\mu\Delta-\frac{1}{2}\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}V(u)\,\d u +\rho\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W_V(u)\\ &+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W(u)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Substituting Eq.\eqref{dW_V} into it, we get
\begin{equation}\label{lnX}
\begin{split}
   \ln X(t+\Delta)=&\ln X(t)+\mu\Delta+\frac{\rho}{\nu}(V(t+\Delta)-V(t)-\kappa\theta\Delta)+\bigg(\frac{\kappa\rho}{\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\bigg)\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}V(u)\,\d u\\
    &+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W(u).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We need to find appropriate approximation for the integrals in Eq.\eqref{lnX}. For now, we simply write
\begin{equation}\label{approx_du}
  \int_{t}^{t+\Delta}V(u)\,\d u \approx \Delta[\gamma_1 V(t)+\gamma_2 V(t+\Delta)]
\end{equation}
Conditioning on $V(t)$ and $\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}V(u)\,\d u$, the It$\hat{\text{o}}$ integral
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W(u)
\end{equation*}
is Gaussian with mean zero and variance $\int_{t}^{t+\Delta}V(u)\,\d u$. So, we write
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{t}^{t+\Delta}\sqrt{V(u)}\,\d W(u)\approx \Delta\sqrt{\gamma_1V(t)+\gamma_2V(t+\Delta)}\cdot Z
\end{equation*}
Therefore, we have the following discretiztion scheme
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
  \text{ln}\hat{X}(t+\Delta)=\text{ln}\hat{X}(t)+K_0+K_1\hat{V}(t)+K_2\hat{V}(t+\Delta)+\sqrt{K_3\hat{V}(t)+K_4\hat{V}(t+\Delta)}\cdot Z
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian random variable, independent of $\hat{V}$, and $K_0,\dots,K_4$ are given by
\begin{align*}
  K_0&=-\frac{\rho\kappa\theta}{\nu}\Delta &
  K_1&=\gamma_1\Delta\bigg(\frac{\kappa\rho}{\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\bigg)-\frac{\rho}{\nu},\\ K_2&=\gamma_2\Delta\bigg(\frac{\kappa\rho}{\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\bigg)+\frac{\rho}{\nu}, & K_3&=\gamma_1\Delta(1-\rho^2), \\  K_4&=\gamma_2\Delta(1-\rho^2).
\end{align*}
where $\gamma_1=\gamma_2=\frac{1}{2}$ in Anderson (2006).

\subsubsection{Implementation steps}

With given values of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ and combined with the simulation scheme of $V$, the discretization scheme for ln$X$ can be generated in the following fashion:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given $\hat{V}(t)$, generate $\hat{V}(t+\Delta)$ using QE schemes
  \item Draw a uniform random number $U$, independent of all random numbers used for $\hat{V}(t+\Delta)$
  \item Set $Z=\Phi^{-1}(U)$
  \item Given ln$\hat{X}(t)$, $\hat{V}(t)$ and the value for $\hat{V}(t+\Delta)$ computed in Step 1, compute ln$\hat{X}(t+\Delta)$ from Eq.\eqref{eq3}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Martingale correction}
Under the QE scheme, a martingale correction scheme is illustrated in Andersen (2006).
%\begin{equation*}
%E(\hat{X}(t+\Delta)|\hat{X}(t))=\hat{X}e^{K^*_0+(K_1+\frac{1}{2}K_3)\hat{V}(t)}E(e^{(K_2+\frac{1}{2}K_4)\hat{V}(t+\Delta)})=\hat{X}
%\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \text{ln}\hat{X}(t+\Delta)=\text{ln}\hat{X}(t)+K_0^*+K_1\hat{V}(t)+K_2\hat{V}(t+\Delta)+\sqrt{K_3\hat{V}(t)+K_4\hat{V}(t+\Delta)}\cdot Z
\end{equation*}
where
\[
  K_0^*=
  \begin{cases}
    -\frac{Ab^2a}{1-2Aa}+\frac{1}{2}\text{ln}(1-2Aa)-(K_1+\frac{1}{2}{K_3}){\hat{V}(t)},\,&\psi\leq\psi_c,\\
    -\text{ln}\bigg(\frac{\beta(1-p)}{\beta-A}\bigg)-(K_1+\frac{1}{2}{K_3}){\hat{V}(t)},&\psi>\psi_c
  \end{cases}
  \]
and $A=K_2+\frac{1}{2}K_4$.
